# EEL-5105-Circuitos-e-Tecnicas-Digitais
During the course EEL 5105, our teacher, Dr. Eduardo Batista, asked us to develop a battlship game in VHDL. Yet the code
has not been documented, this repository has some files with info about the project. The code is 100% funcional on the 
simulation as well on the FPGA. Especially thanks to my project partner @caiopo for the incredible suport on this project.
